# Flask WebAuthn Demo

[Live Demo](https://flask-webauthn.rickhenry.dev)

This is my demo application showing how I used 
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) and 
[WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide) to create a fully passwordless login
flow. I wrote a [series of blog posts](https://rickhenry.dev/blog/posts/flask-webauthn-demo-1)
about building it. [Try out](https://flask-webauthn.rickhenry.dev) the
live demo.


## Different from blog
This branch does not exactly match the source from the end of my blog series. The changes
are mostly CSS and adapting it to be deployed to my [dokku](https://dokku.com) server.
For the exact version [checkout this branch](https://github.com/rickh94/flask-webauthn-demo/tree/part-7-notifications).
